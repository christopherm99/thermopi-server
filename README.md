# ThermoPi
ThermoPi is attempt to make a simple, extensible, and powerful thermostat framework for the Raspberry Pi. The backend is
written in Golang, using Echo to power the server, and Stianeikeland's go-rpio library to control the Raspberry Pi's
GPIO pins. The frontend is written using Vue.js and TypeScript, and can be found 
[here](https://github.com/christopherm99/thermopi-webapp). Finally, the code for the peripheral sensors is written in
Arduino C++, using an Adafruit library to interface with their thermometer module, the MCP9808.
## Hardware
ThermoPi has been developed for the Raspberry Pi 3B+, with the official Raspberry Pi touchscreen, which can be found
[here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) and 
[here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/), respectively, to host the Golang server. The
code for the peripheral sensors has been designed to run on the Arduino MKR 1010, and the Adafruit MCP9890, found 
[here](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-mkr-wifi-1010) and [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1782).
Both of these systems can likely be switched out with alternatives, provided there is some tweaking of the respective
code.
## Installation
Ensure you have at least [Golang 1.11](https://golang.org/) and [NodeJS v11](https://nodejs.org/) installed. 
Then run this on the server:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/christopherm99/thermopi-server.git thermopi
cd thermopi
[sudo] ./install.sh
```
The install script should tell you where thermoPi has been installed to. 

Note: It is possible that thermoPi will work with different versions of Go and NodeJS, but they have not been tested.
### Arduino Code
To flash the arduino code to your device, follow these steps
1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
2. Install the package for the MKR 1010 in the IDE, via Tools > Board > Boards Manager, and searching for Arduino SAMD.
3. Install the Adafruit_MCP9808.h library, via Tools > Manage Libraries, and searching for Adafruit MCP9808.
4. Select the newly installed board from Tools > Board > Arduino MKR WiFi 1010.
5. Select the correct port for the board (plug in the cable to the Arduino first) from Tools > Port.
6. Open the code for the peripheral from Files > Open, and navigating to the peripheral subdirectory of the GitHub repo.
7. Edit lines 6 and 7 so that they reflect the proper values.
8. Flash the code by clicking the upload button (âž¡) at the top left corner of the editor. 
## Configuration
ThermoPi can be configured using either commandline flags, as defined in usage or with a configuration file. ThermoPi 
will check for a config file at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/thermoPi/thermoPi.conf`, or if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset, at 
`$HOME/.config/thermoPi/thermoPi.conf`. If not found, thermoPi will create a template file there. The config file 
should follow this format. See below for variable explanation.
```toml
[thermoPi]
lockout   = "10m10s"
compPin   = 4 
fanPin    = 5 
verbosity = 1 
```
### Lockout Setting
To prevent burnout of the air compressor, thermoPi has a lockout time period, which defaults to 1 minute. This means
if the signal is given to the compressor to start cooling, thermoPi must wait this amount of time before turning off
the compressor, and vise versa.
### Pin Settings
For the compressor and fan pin values, see [this](https://pinout.xyz/) diagram to find out which BCM pins you are using.
### Verbosity Settings
* Level -1 (Silent): Only fatal errors are displayed.
* Level 0 (Quiet): Only errors are displayed. 
* Level 1 (Normal): Only errors and normal messages displayed (eg. the server port and ip).
* Level 2 (Debug): Only errors, messages, and warnings displayed.
* Level 3 (Verbose): All possible messages displayed.
## Running
To run the server, first install it, as explained in the Installation section. The output of install.sh should give you
a file to run (/usr/local/bin in most cases). Run this to start the server.
## Extensibility
### API Specification
NOTE: All temperatures should be in centigrade.
#### For Frontend Development:
* GET /target: Get current target temperature for this time slot.
  *  Response Format Example:
     ```json
     { 
       "target":25 
     }
     ```
* POST /target: Set current target temperature for this time slot.
  * Request Format: A POST request with the following parameters:
    ```
    target    - The new target temperature
    permanent - Whether this change ought to be updated in the permanent schedule. Defaults to off.
    ```
  * Possible Responses:
    * 202 - The POST request was accepted and will be reflected soon.
    * 400 - The POST request is malformed (eg. too large a value) and will not be reflected.
    * 5xx - The POST request was valid, but the server had an error.
* GET /sensors: Get list of active sensors' ids.
  * Response Format Example:
    ```json
    [
      "Bedroom",
      "Kitchen",
      "Living Room"
    ]
    ```
* GET /sensors/{id}: Get most recent temperature reading from {id} sensor.
  * Response Format Example:
    ```json
    { "value":22 }
    ```
#### For Sensor Development:
* POST /sensors/{id}: Receive data from {id} sensor.
  * Request Format: A POST request with the following parameters:
    ```
    value - The most recent temperature reading from the sensor.
    ```
  * Note: This will probably be replaced with MQTT in the future.
### Server Modularity:
The Golang server does not require the Vue.js webapp to be served, and anything could be served by the Echo server, in
theory. To serve different files,
